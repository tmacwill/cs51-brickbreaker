      <P> BrickBreaker is a fast-paced, competitive version of the classic game Breakout. You can design an infinite variety of levels in BrickBreaker's level editor, which allows you to set a number of parameters, in addition to brick position, such as brick type, number of players, and dimensions of the playing field. You can access the levels created and uploaded by other users through a seemless interface as well as share your own creations. BrickBreaker is addictive.
	
      <P> To use BrickBreaker, download and uncompress <a href="../../FinalProject.jar">this file</a>. In the uncompressed directory, run the command "chmod 715 brickbreaker.sh". 
      Then run "./brickbreaker.sh". Once the application begins, you may login with the username/password combo test/test. 
      Or, visit <a href="http://bit.ly/cs51-brickbreaker">http://bit.ly/cs51-brickbreaker</a> to register your own account. 
      If logging in, downloading a level, posting a high score, or uploading a level fails due to a server timeout, simply try again.
      Brick Breaker can also be configured to run on a local server by following the instructions in INSTALL.txt.
